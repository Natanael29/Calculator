# Angular Calculator

This task was to create a calculator using Angular framework in order to practice and get used to the way this framework works. This calculator implements the main four operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication and division. As an improvement, I added the square root and the power of two operations. 
To perform this project, I created a component that includes the calculator logic, its template, styles and ts files. To catch the keystrokes, I added click events to the buttons containing numbers and operations to manage them with functions from the .ts file.
This activity has given me a wider knowledge about how a project is structured in Angular, how components work, and also how to deploy an Angular project using GitHub.
